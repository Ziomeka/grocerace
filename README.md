# Grocerace

_Grocerace_ is a real-time collaborative shopping list app built as a **portfolio-driven project**. The goal is to demonstrate practical frontend skills using modern technologies, and to explore backend fundamentals.

I hate shopping, so I want it over with as fast as possible. This app is a mix of problem-solving and showing off what I can do.

## Project Status

This is a **work in progress** and still under active development. Many features are missing or incomplete. Expect rough edges, placeholder UI, and untested logic.


## Tech Stack

This project uses tools and patterns chosen primarily to reflect professional frontend development practices. Backend is intentionally minimal.

### Frontend

- [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/)
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) with `<script setup>`
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [UnoCSS](https://github.com/unocss/unocss) utility-first styling
- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) for real-time updates
- [PNPM workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) for monorepo structure

### Backend

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- No database (yet)


## Monorepo Structure
â”œâ”€ app â†’ frontend client (Vue 3)<br>
â”œâ”€ server â†’ backend API (Express + Socket.IO)<br>
â”œâ”€ shared â†’ shared types/utils
